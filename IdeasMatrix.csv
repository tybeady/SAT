hgr watcher	I already started this a bit but basically the idea is you set up a search through the parameters the website provides then we change the url to not limit search results ie (https://hgrinc.com/surplus/electronics/?all=0&last_chance=&view=grid&aisle=&from=&to=&markdowns=0&newarrivals=1&sort=&kw=&per_page=24&min_price=0&max_price=100&pn=1) then change per_page. Then we notify the user when something changes with there search	7	Medium/High	6		hardest part is probably gonna be the front end.
